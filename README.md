# CS:GO Data Science Interpreter
Using Python, this semester project for my Data Science class focuses on gathering statistics that we can use to display and predict outcomes for pro games of Counter Strike:Global Offensive.
We gather information such as players and their ratings, team pistol rounds and potential round conversions, usages of weapons, and more. This information 
is specified by user input. User can input date range, map name, and whether team starts on Terrorist or Counter Terrorist side.

## Data
[HLTV](https://www.hltv.org/stats) first website for scraping.
[ggScore](https://ggscore.com/en/csgo) second website for scraping.
## Tools
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) Used for web scraping our data.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Used to sort and organize data that is outputted into CSV file
